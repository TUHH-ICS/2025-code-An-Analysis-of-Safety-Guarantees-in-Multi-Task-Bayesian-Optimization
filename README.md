# An Analysis of Safety Guarantees in Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization

## General

This repository contains supplementary material and the code to reproduce the tables and figures presented in 

> J. O. LÃ¼bsen, A. Eichler, "An Anlysis of Safety Guarantees in Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization"


To run the proposed SaMSBO algorithm, the user can use the 'run_SaMSBO.py' file. To run the safe UCB algorithm for comparison, the user can use the 'run_SafeUCB.py' file.
Additionally, the script 'example.py' visualizes the optimization of a one-dimensional example.

The data used for plots to generate the figures in the manuscript are in the data folder. The user can use the 'generate_plots.ipynb' notebook to recreate the figures in the 'plot_scripts' folder.

## Prerequisites

To run the code install python3.12.8 and the dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`.

> pip install -r requirements.txt

The code in this repository was tested in the following environment:

* *Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS
* *Python 3.12.8
